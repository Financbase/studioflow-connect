# System Integration Requirements

To fully realize the project's potential, several critical integration points need to be developed:

## 1. File System Drivers
- Native kernel extensions for Mac, Windows, and Linux
- Virtual file system implementation
- Direct disk access libraries
- File format translation layer

## 2. Plugin Bridge System
- VST/AU/AAX wrapper architecture
- Sandboxed plugin host environment
- State persistence system
- Cross-platform compatibility layer
- Low-latency audio transport mechanism

## 3. DAW Plugin System
- VST/AU/AAX plugins that connect DAWs to StudioFlow X
- Inter-application communication protocol
- MIDI and audio routing infrastructure

## 4. VM Management System
- Integration with virtualization platforms (VMWare, VirtualBox, Hyper-V)
- Custom audio drivers for low-latency cross-VM audio routing
- Resource scheduling and prioritization

## 5. External API Integrations
- Music distribution platforms
- Content ID systems
- Licensing organizations
