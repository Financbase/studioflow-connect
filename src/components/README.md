# Frontend Component Architecture Documentation

## Component Structure

The StudioFlow application follows a component-based architecture with a focus on:
- Reusability
- Maintainability
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility

### Core Principles

1. **Component Composition**: Components are built from smaller, focused components
2. **Single Responsibility**: Each component has a clear, single responsibility
3. **Hooks for Logic**: Business logic is separated into custom hooks
4. **Responsive Design**: All components adapt to different screen sizes

## Key Components

### UI Components

- `PageContainer`: Responsive container with accessibility features
- `DashboardWidget`: Collapsible widget for dashboard sections
- `Breadcrumbs`: Navigation breadcrumbs with overflow handling
- Shadcn UI components for consistent design

### Dashboard Components

- `MainDashboardContent`: Primary dashboard content organizing multiple widgets
- `DashboardActions`: User action buttons for the dashboard
- `AnalyticsCard`, `UsageStatsCard`, etc.: Specialized dashboard data displays

### Audio Components

- `AudioAnalysis`: Audio visualization and playback components
- `FrequencyVisualizer`, `WaveformVisualizer`: Specialized audio visualizations
- `AudioControls`: Playback controls for audio assets

### Support Components

- `TicketItem`, `TicketDetailsDialog`: Support ticket management components
- `MessageHistory`, `ReplyForm`: Communication components

## Custom Hooks

### UI/UX Hooks

- `useResponsiveLayout`: Screen size detection and responsive utility classes
- `useFocusManagement`: Focus trapping and management for accessibility
- `useErrorHandling`: Centralized error handling with toast notifications
- `useStableCallback`: Performance optimization for callback functions

### Feature-Specific Hooks

- `useDashboard`: Dashboard context and management
- `useWidgetVisibility`: Widget display logic
- `useCustomLayout`: Custom dashboard layout management
- `useViewMode`: Dashboard view mode management

## State Management

The application uses React Context for global state management:
- `DashboardContext`: Dashboard configuration and widget state
- `ThemeContext`: Theme and appearance settings
- `LanguageContext`: Internationalization and translations

## Performance Considerations

1. **Memoization**: Components and values are memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders
2. **Code Splitting**: Components are loaded lazily when needed
3. **Debouncing**: Event handlers are debounced for better performance
4. **Optimized Rendering**: Components avoid re-rendering when props haven't changed

## Accessibility Features

1. **Proper Semantics**: Semantic HTML elements for better screen reader support
2. **Focus Management**: Focus is properly managed for keyboard navigation
3. **ARIA Attributes**: ARIA attributes for improved assistive technology support
4. **Color Contrast**: Color schemes meet WCAG contrast requirements

## Styling Approach

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with:
- Consistent utility classes
- Component-specific extensions
- Theme variants for different visual styles
- Responsive design utilities

## Future Improvement Areas

1. **Test Coverage**: Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
2. **Animation Optimization**: Ensure animations are performant on low-end devices
3. **Further Component Splitting**: Break down remaining large components
4. **Advanced Caching**: Implement more sophisticated data caching strategies

## Best Practices for Contributors

1. Follow the established component patterns
2. Extract business logic to custom hooks
3. Ensure components are responsive and accessible
4. Use the provided UI components and utilities
5. Document new components and hooks
